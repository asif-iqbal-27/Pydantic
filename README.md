# 🐍 Exploring Pydantic

This repository contains hands-on examples and notes to understand and practice **Pydantic**, a Python library for data validation and settings management using type annotations.

## 📘 Overview

Pydantic allows you to define Python classes that validate the data they receive. It integrates type hints with runtime validation, making data handling in Python safer and more efficient.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Why and when to use Pydantic
- Field-level validation and constraints
- Model-level validation using custom logic
- Computed fields and derived data
- Nested models and complex structures
- Serialization and parsing techniques

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pydantic` library (preferably v2)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pydantic
